# Global Country Development & Prosperity Index Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description
This project aims to predict the Prosperity Index of countries using various regression techniques. The dataset used is the "2023 Global Country Development & Prosperity Index".
The goal is to build a robust predictive model with high accuracy.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- joblib

## Files in the Repository
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `code.py`: Python script with data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
- `models/`: Serialized models and results.
- `visualizations/`: Plots and graphs generated during data exploration and model evaluation.

## Summary of Results
The best-performing model was found to be Gradient Boosting Regression, which achieved the lowest RMSE and highest RÂ² on the validation set. Key features impacting the Prosperity Index included GDP per capita, education levels, and healthcare access.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/global-prosperity-index.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd global-prosperity-index`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the script to see the data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling steps.
2. Load the trained models from the `models/` directory to make predictions on new data.
